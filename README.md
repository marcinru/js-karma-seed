# [Kata Seeds](http://kata-seeds.github.io): JavaScript + [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) (with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/))

## Getting Started

Clone this repo with `git`:

    git clone https://github.com/marcinru/js-karma-seed.git
    cd js-karma-seed

Install dependencies with `npm`:

    npm install

To run your tests use `npm test` to run once or use

    npm run karma

to use a watcher to check for file changes.
You should eventually see 1 test ran and 0 fails.
Try to fix it.

**Hint for WebStorm users**
*You can right click the karma.conf.js file to run the tests.*
